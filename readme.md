Task: Matrix multiplication with a twist.

Create a sample Laravel / Lumen application for Matrix multiplication. The input should be based on a command OR Rest-API.

Validation
For Matrix multiplication, the column count in the first matrix should be equal to the row count of the second matrix. If this condition is not met, a validation error should be thrown.

Resulting matrix 
The resulting matrix should contain characters rather than numbers, similar to excel columns. Example 1 => A, 26 => Z, 27 => AA, 28 => AB. The calculation should be covered by tests.
